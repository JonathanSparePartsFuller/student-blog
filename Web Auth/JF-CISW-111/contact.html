    <p color="white" style="text-align: center;">Hello reader, my name is <strong>Jonathan Fuller</strong> and this is my first html page for Web Authoring 111. This isn't the first website I've made, but it has been about a year since I last made a web page from start to finish. Since I just moved to the <em>Magic Valley</em> area, I haven't had many opportunites to explore what the area has to offer, but I am enjoying the snow we're getting. Besides that, I do play a lot of video games in my free time and I'm excited for the new releases this year (2024). I do want to get into more outdoor recreation stuff, like kayaking in the surrounding lakes or even the snake river. I do have experience in web development, but there's still plenty that I would like to learn to perfect the craft.
